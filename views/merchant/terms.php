The arbitration must be conducted in Canoga Park, California, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If a Member files a claim or counterclaim against Scanflip, the Member must do so on an individual basis and not with any other Member or as part of a class action or class wide arbitration.

This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which hereby is expressly excluded. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Scanflip, the Member, or any other party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California (the "Court"), and each party hereby consents to and agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the Court for the purpose of seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief pending the completion of the arbitration.  Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.
